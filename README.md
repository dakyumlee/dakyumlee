Hello, Iâ€™m Dakyum Lee, currently studying web development.
Iâ€™m building small projects one by one, enjoying both the fun and challenges of coding.

ðŸ’» Iâ€™ve created simple web apps using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
ðŸ“± Lately, Iâ€™ve been exploring responsive design, PWAs, and Firebase.
ðŸŽ¨ Iâ€™m also interested in UI/UX and enjoy designing and implementing things myself.

Right now, Iâ€™m focused on building my portfolio and growing with an emphasis on clean code and collaboration.
Iâ€™m still learning, but Iâ€™m committed to steady progress and documenting my journey.

Thank you!ðŸ™Œ
